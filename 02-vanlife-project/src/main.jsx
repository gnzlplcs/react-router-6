/**
Challenge:
Bootstrap the VanLife project by creating the first 2 routes:
Home and About.

Also include the navbar that can link between the two routes.
For now, you'll either need to copy/paste the navbar code to both Home and About pages, or you'll need to find a place to put it where it can be shared between the two pages. (Don't overthink this part - just do whatever is easiest for you because we'll learn a better approach very soon)

Review challenge: do all the CSS yourself based on the design linked in the slides.
